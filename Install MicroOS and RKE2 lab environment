#1 Download the iso and install the linux VM in a hypervisor:
https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:MicroOS/Downloads
#2. Make sure root is available for ssh
cat > /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/auth.conf
PermitRootLogin yes
#3. install RKE2
https://docs.rke2.io/install/quickstart
4. Further configuration
To install kubectl run:
sudo curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
 
#We also have to ensure that kubectl can connect to our Kubernetes cluster. For this, kubectl uses standard Kubeconfig files which it looks for in a KUBECONFIG environment variable or in a ~/.kube/config file in the user's home directory.
#RKE2 writes the Kubeconfig of a cluster to /etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml.
#We can copy the /etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml file to our ~/.kube/config file so that kubectl can interact with our cluster:
mkdir -p ~/.kube
sudo cp /etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml ~/.kube/config
sudo chown ec2-user: ~/.kube/config
 
In order to test that we can properly interact with our cluster, we can execute two commands.
To list all the nodes in the cluster and check their status:
kubectl get nodes
 
The cluster should have one node, and the status should be "Ready".
To list all the Pods in all Namespaces of the cluster:
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
 
All Pods other than helm shoud have the status "Running".
